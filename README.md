# Make A FullStack App

Create an complete fullstack lab using Node, Express, Mongo(oose), and React.

This app tracks restaurants and user ratings by Portland neighborhood

## App

### Main App States ("pages") aka Routes 

1. `/` - A main welcome/landing page that greets users and is publically assessable.
2. `/neighborhoods` - A Neighborhood page that lists all neighborhoods showing the name of the neigborhood
along with count of saved restaurants for each neighborhood.
    1. Provide a way for the user to select one quadrant and list will filter **client side** to that quadrant. The filter should be reflected in the url. The filter should have an "all" choice that resets to all neighboorhoods. 
    1. User should be able to add a new neighborhood. Can be inline or use a popup.
    1. User can click on a neighborhood and transition to the `/neighborhoods/:id` state
3. `/neighborhoods/:id` - Shows a list of all restaurants that have been saved to that neigborhood, 
and an average user rating.
    1. The list should default from highest-ranking to lowest, but offer an option to toggle sort order (client side sorting) to lowest-to-highest.
    1. User can add a new restaurant. Can be inline or use a popup.
    1. If the user added the restaurant, they can delete it.
    1. User can click on a restaurant and go to the `/restaurants/:id` state.
    1. Provide a way for the user to go back to the neighborhood the restaurant belongs in
4. `/restaurants/:id` - Detail view of restaurant and list of ratings by user.
    1. User can add a rating to a restaurant between 1 and 5 "starts" and leave a comment. 
  They can change their existing rating and comment, but cannot add a second.
    1. Provide a way for the user to go back to the restaurant
  
Routes 2, 3 and 4 are protected, there must be a valid signed in user.

Neighborhoods, restaurants and ratings are visible across all users.

You need to offer ability to sign up and sign in.

### Testing

You need to write snaphot tests for all components. Unit tests for pur js logic modules.

## Server

### API 

The server needs to offer a data API that supports the above app flows:

* Sign in, up, token validation. User needs to include a required `username` field along with `password`
* Create `neighborhood` (takes a name and "quadrant" which is one of N, NW, SW, SE, or NE. All fields required)
* Create `restaurant` (`name`, and `neighborhood` (id key to neighborhood), `createdBy` (user id who created)
`address`, which is complex object with `street`, `city`, and `zip` properties. All fields required)
* Delete `restaurant` (must validate it was created by same user trying to delete) which should also delete 
any `reviews` associated with that restaurnat
* Create/Update a `review`. Review has `restaurantId`, `userId`, `rating` (number between 1 and 5 inclusive), and `comment`. 
All fields except comment are required.
Review should be updated if submited for existing user/restaurant id's.
* Return a list of `neighborhood`s with a count of restaurants.
  Hint: Here is an example of aggregation definition for grouping a count:
  ```
  Restaurant.aggegate([
    {$group: {
      _id: "neighborhoodId", // where neighborhoodId is the name of the parent (foriegn) key field
      count: {$sum: 1}
    }}
  ])
  .then(/*...*/)
  ```
  You will need to manually join the `Neighborhood.query` results with the above results.
 * Return a list of restaurants for a particular neighborhood. Should include name and average rating.
  Hint: Here is an example of aggregation definition for grouping a count:
  ```
  Rating.aggegate([
    {$group: {
      _id: "restaurantId", // where restaurantId is the name of the parent (foriegn) key field
      rating: {$avg: "rating"} // where rating is name of field that holds the 1-5 value.
    }}
  ])
  .then(/*...*/)
  ```
 * Return a particular restaurant. Includes all fields for that restuarant, populate the neighborhoodId with the name of the 
 neighborhood, plus add a ratings fields that is an array that contains all fields for all rating records that belong to the restaurant. The ratings records should populate the userName from the userId
 
 ### Testing
 
 Write E2E test for all major operations. You only need to do one golden path test for each operation, 
 not exhaustive edge cases.
 
 Unit test models if they have significant functionality.
 
 ## Quality
 
 * Code needs to be clean and consistent. Refactor, code and naming need to be consciously 
 improved beyond "it works" (code is read far more often than written)
 * If there are general things like linting, builds scripts, etc. that we consistently did across 
 projects, do that for this project as well
 
 ## Questions, Clarifications, Did I miss something?
 
 Post an issue to this repo.
 
 You can ask technical questions/advise. I will likely answer if it's the type of question
 you would ask team lead/senior dev on your team.
